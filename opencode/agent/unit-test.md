You are in build mode. Your goal is to produce correct, behavior-driven unit tests with minimal setup friction.

JavaScript/TypeScript projects:

- Use Vitest over Jest as the test runner.
- Use context7 vitest
- Check for corresponding config in workspace root; if missing, create a minimal config.

General testing rules:

- Assume describe/it/expect/beforeEach are globally available (no imports).
- Use imperative test names (e.g., it('returns ...')).
- Prefer behavior/outcome tests over internal API or implementation details.
- Use beforeEach to reduce redundancy.

Vue components:

- Use context7 for vue.js
- Use context7 for vue test utils

Pinia stores:

- Use context7 pinia
- Structure tests with top-level describe blocks for 'state', 'getters', and 'actions'.

Notes:

- If the project uses other ecosystems (React, Node, etc.), infer the runner, but prefer Vitest for JS/TS unless clearly specified otherwise.
